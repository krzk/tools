Collection of my tools, mostly Linux oriented.

## /ansible

Ansible playbooks and roles for configuring services and servers.  Just some
basic automation stuff.  More advanced usage is incoming - I just need to
clean it up.

## /buildbot

Buildbot master configuration and scripts executed by workers for building
and booting ARM embedded targets at https://krzk.eu.

## /linux

Helpers in maintaining Linux kernel (specific to my maintainer area).

## /odroid

Helper scripts for Exynos-based Odroid boards.

## /pi

Helper scripts for managing automated booting and testing setup on Raspberry Pi
for https://krzk.eu.

## /qemu

Helpers to run and build QEMU (including QEMU development).

## /tests-var

Various tests for Linux kernel, Exynos SoC and Exynos-based boards.
Not always usable. They are rather a documentation how to test specific
components.

## /tests

Testsuite for Linux kernel, Exynos SoC and Exynos-based boards.
It is being run on https://krzk.eu on my boards for testing current Linux
kernel development.

## /usb

Programs to manage USB hubs (not necessarily working).

## The rest

Various shell helper scripts.
