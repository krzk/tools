# reduce the bandwidth during cloning and dramatically reduce the mirror size

# set ignore_repo_references to "yes"

# will need to run "git repack -a" and then manually remove the

# This prevents catastrophic mirror purges when our upstream master gives us

# the purge if the remote manifest has over 10% fewer repositories than what we
# have, or in other words, if we have 100 repos and the remote manifest has
# shrunk to 95 repos or less, we refuse to purge, suspecting that something has

# Use shell-globbing to list the repositories you would like to mirror.

#
# mirror everything:

# mirror just the main kernel sources:
#include = /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
#          /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
#          /pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git

# mirror just git:
#include = /pub/scm/git/*

# This is processed after the include. If you want to exclude some specific

# git sources:
#exclude = */linux-2.4*
